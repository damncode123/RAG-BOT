This is a test document for the RAG Bot upload functionality.

The document contains information about:
- File upload processing
- Card-style responses
- Conversation integration
- Real-time status updates

When this document is uploaded, it should:
1. Show a processing card in the conversation
2. Process the document in the background
3. Create embeddings in Pinecone
4. Show a success card when complete
5. Allow immediate querying of the document content

This test will verify that the new upload card functionality works correctly.
